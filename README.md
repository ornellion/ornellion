- 👋 Hi, I’m @ornellion - though most people call me Ornella
- 👀 I’m interested in: discovering just how cool data is and what we can do with it 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: full-stack web development. So far Python is still my favourite language :heart_eyes:
- 💞️ Current loves: journalling, sketching portraits, consuming an abundance of teas
